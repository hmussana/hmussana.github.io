                <p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Hassan, a Security Professional with super-paranoid instincts; a software engineer by education, a DevSecOps advocate, a lover of turn-based &amp; real-time strategy games, a chai lover, a cook, and a history buff.
Ever since I worked on my first incident in AWS environment, I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by Cloud tech in general and AWS in specific. I&rsquo;ve been working as a Cloud Security SME for a while now and sharpening my Cloud-Native security axe these days.</p>
<h2 id="the-odyssey">The Odyssey</h2>
<p>After I had completed my Bachelors in Software Engineering, my security journey started in Pakistan (my home country ðŸ’š ), as a Security Analyst in one of the top MSSPs(Managed Security Services Provider) in the region called <a href="https://www.ebryx.com/">Ebryx</a>, situated in the city of Lahore, a tech-hub in the country.</p>
<p>I quickly rose the career ladder there and wore various hats in a short span of almost three and a half years. My security journey has had three major phases as below:</p>
<h3 id="chaotic-start">Chaotic Start</h3>
<p>The start of my career in Ebryx was as a Level 1 SOC Analyst, however, I used to work on various fronts. Soon I wore the hat of L2 SOC Analyst while still working on security assessments &amp; hardening projects alongside. I was also a part of numerous security incidents' investigation &amp; response.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I worked on during this time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up logging/traffic collection for security monitoring</li>
<li>Continuously Monitoring and intrusion analysis in 24/7 SOC</li>
<li>Identifying new detection use cases and ingesting new log sources</li>
<li>Parsing &amp; making sense of numerous log types</li>
<li>Developing detection rules for various security log types &amp; correlation rules on top of them for various SIEM solutions</li>
<li>Developing response playbooks for numerous attacks</li>
<li>Continuous capacity building</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="progressive-era">Progressive Era</h3>
<p>By this time, I was working as a senior member of the team at Ebryx where I mentored &amp; helped build a dozen-strong team of defenders. And my focus shifted more into the cloud security arena. All along this chaotic yet exciting time, I was a part of various security incident response activities and also led some of those. This was also the beginning of my love for cloud technologies generally. I was also a freelancer during this time, practically working 16 hrs a day, which also broadened my horizons.</p>
<p>I worked on various fronts in this phase and hence acquired experience in a no. of domains. Following are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping establishing a SOC team and mentoring fellow blue-teamers</li>
<li>Security by Design initiative for a Cloud-based client</li>
<li>Automating basic response activities in the cloud</li>
<li>Developing configuration monitoring in the cloud</li>
<li>Setting up security monitoring in AWS using Elk stack and writing detection use-cases tailored for attacks against cloud infrastructure &amp; IAM</li>
<li>Setting up honeynets and honeytokens to improve detection</li>
<li>Developing attack detection playbooks and rules for an in-house Cloud Infrastructure Security Platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>I took the next career step to start working in Germany as a DevSecOps Engineer at the beginning of 2019. Where my focus was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing AWS CloudFormation &amp; Terraform templates for security-hardened infrastructure.</li>
<li>Writing Ansible automation for configuration management</li>
<li>Source code review of infrastructure code (IaC)</li>
<li>Setting up &amp; maintaining Infrastructure Deployment Pipelines using Jenkins, CodePipeline etc.</li>
<li>Setting up health &amp; security monitoring as code mostly in terraform.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="glorious-now">Glorious Now</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m working in <a href="https://engineering.hellofresh.com/">Hellofresh</a> now as a Cloud Security SME in the Core Security Engineering and Incident Response team.
Some of the things I do at work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving IAM in the cloud</li>
<li>Writing python code to automate stuff</li>
<li>Incident <del>response</del> rants</li>
<li>Write Infrastructure as code templates</li>
<li>Continuously assessing and hardening the cloud infrastructure</li>
<li>Solving security challenges in Cloud-Native environments</li>
<li>Learning all the time!</li>
</ul>
