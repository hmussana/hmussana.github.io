<p>Hi! I am Hassan Mussana. A security guy with super-paranoid instincts; a software engineer, a DevSecOps advocate, a lover of turn-based &amp; real-time strategy games, a grammar <del>nazi</del>, a chai lover, a cook, and a history buff.</p>
<p>Can <del>sniff</del> sift through a lot of log types and find out where is the fuck-up and also the guy who wouldn&rsquo;t approve your PR if things are not aligned or not in alphabetical order or have extra spaces.</p>
<p>Yes, that <code>,</code> before &lsquo;and&rsquo; in the first paragraph is intentional, and I <em><em>believe</em></em> if you don&rsquo;t get it then you&rsquo;ve got a <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/oxford-comma-debate/">problem</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-odyssey">The Odyssey</h2>
<p>After I had completed my Bachelors in Software Engineering, my security journey started in Pakistan (My home country ðŸ’š ), as a Security Analyst in one of the top MSSPs(Managed Security Services Provider) in the region called <a href="https://www.ebryx.com/">Ebryx</a>, situated in the city of Lahore, a tech-hub in the country.</p>
<p>I quickly rose the career ladder there and worked in various teams in a short span of almost three and a half years. My career journey has had three major phases.</p>
<h3 id="chaotic-start">Chaotic Start</h3>
<p>The start of my career in Ebryx was as an L1 SOC Analyst, however, I used to work on various fronts. Soon I became an L2 SOC Analyst while still working on security assessments &amp; hardening projects. I was also a part of numerous security incidents investigation &amp; response during this time in traditional enterprise networks.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I worked on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up logging/traffic collection</li>
<li>Identifying new detection use cases and ingesting new log sources</li>
<li>Parsing &amp; making sense of numerous log types</li>
<li>Developing detection rules for various security log types &amp; correlation rules on top of them for various SIEM solutions</li>
<li>Rolling out &amp; using endpoint detection &amp; response (EDR) platforms (Carbon Black mainly)</li>
<li>Developing response playbooks for numerous attacks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="progressive-era">Progressive Era</h3>
<p>By this time, I was working as a senior member of the team at Ebryx where I mentored &amp; helped build a dozen-strong team of defenders. And my focus shifted more into the cloud security arena. All along this chaotic yet exciting time, I was a part of various security incident response activities and also lead some of those. This was also the beginning of my love for cloud generally. I was also a freelancer during this time, practically working 16 hrs a day, which also broadened my horizons.</p>
<p>I worked on various fronts in this phase and hence acquired experience in a no. of domains including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security by Design initiative</li>
<li>Establishing a SOC monitoring team</li>
<li>Automating basic response activities in the cloud</li>
<li>Developing configuration monitoring in the cloud</li>
<li>Setting up security monitoring in AWS using Elk stack and writing detection use-cases tailored for attacks against cloud infrastructure &amp; IAM</li>
<li>Setting up honeynets and honeytokens to improve detection</li>
<li>Numerous evaluations of security detection</li>
<li>Developing attack detection playbooks and rules for an in-house developed Cloud Infrastructure Security Platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>I took the next step to start working in Germany as a DevSecOps Engineer at the beginning of 2019. Where my focus was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing AWS CloudFormation &amp; Terraform templates for security-hardened infrastructure.</li>
<li>Writing Ansible automation for configuration management</li>
<li>Source code review of infrastructure code (IaC)</li>
<li>Setting up &amp; maintaining Infrastructure Deployment Pipelines using Jenkins, CodePipeline etc.</li>
<li>Setting up health &amp; security monitoring as code.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="glorious-now">Glorious Now</h3>
<p>I work for <a href="https://engineering.hellofresh.com/">Hellofresh</a> now in Berlin. Nowadays, I&rsquo;m solving security challenges in cloud environments while also enjoying the luxury of just creating &amp; destroying servers on the whim of a command! It&rsquo;s a love-hate relationship.
Some of the things I do out of interest &amp; at work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write python code to automate stuff.</li>
<li>Incident <del>response</del> rants.</li>
<li>Write Infrastructure code -&gt; yaml &raquo; json.</li>
<li>Randomly analyse my network traffic any time.</li>
<li>Hardening the cloud infrastructure</li>
<li>Improving IAM in the cloud</li>
<li>Are you still reading? &lsquo;Tis not an interview!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>And the opinions are mine and stuff</strong>  ðŸ¤£</p>
